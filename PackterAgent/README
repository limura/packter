* Introduction
	PACKTER is a tool for visualization of Internet traffic.

	As PACKTER can figure out the source IP, destination IP, source port and destination port in 3D viewer, operators can easily recognize the feature of Internet Traffic Patterns.
	PACTER also works with snort or tcpdump and informs operators to DoS or some attacks which are just performed now.
