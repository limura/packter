== PACKTER ==
This command is used for drawing flying objects. The format is as follows.
{{{
PACKTER
SRCIP,DSTIP,SRCPORT,DSTPORT,FLAG,DESCRIPTION
}}}
where SRCIP and DSTIP are dot quatted IPv4 address or colon separeted IPv6 address, SRCPORT and DSTPORT are numeric higher than 0 and less than 65535. FLAG is identifier for the types of flying objects. Default settings of packter, flag can be specified 0, 1, ... 9. DESCRIPTION is string and used for showing packet description in Packet Viewer. This field is also used for IP Traceback.
For example,

{{{
PACKTERSOUND
TIME,SOUNDFILE
}}}
TIME is a numeric and designates playing time for BGM. SOUNDFILE is a string and designates a BGM file. This file also should be placed in the working directory of the packter.
For example,
{{{
PACKTERSOUND
60,bgm01.wav
}}}
